// NEEDS TEMPLATE!

// Integration tests should be the only tests that are not mocked AT ALL!

// They will describe "user stories" ie. a complete interaction with the system (from a user view), aka. acceptance testing

// They should work and call the desired docker-compose endpoints
// Such tests are only possible, when a stable testing environment (with known endpoints) can be Setup
// Should take a bit more planning before jumping in.

// However, the tests should mostly resemble the page_template, given it best represents what users does.
