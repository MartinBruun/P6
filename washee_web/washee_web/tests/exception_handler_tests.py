# Test that an Exception Handler Class can be initialized

# Test that the Exception Handler can take an Exception, and then
# either write to a log, print to the console OR crash the program
# (This represents different security levels 
#  / if we work in development or production)

# Writes to a log should be timestamped and (if applicable) 
# what user did it, and what action was the cause
