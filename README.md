# P6

This is the repository used for the bachelor project for the 6. Semester Software 2022
This description should be replaced with a proper presentation, when it has been done.

CURRENTLY SETUP AS A PYTHON PROJECT BUT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!

## Setup done in the settings
- It is only possible to Squash merge. What this means is that all commits are "squashed" together into one single commit, so that one branch only fills up one commit.

## Maybe Useful Resources and Libraries
- Dockerfile made from this: https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/
- A way to test Docker maybe: https://github.com/avast/pytest-docker
