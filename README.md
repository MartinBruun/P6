# P6

This is the repository used for the bachelor project for the 6. Semester Software 2022
This description should be replaced with a proper presentation, when it has been done.

CURRENTLY SETUP AS A PYTHON PROJECT BUT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!

## Project board
- Use githubs own project overview instead of trello perhaps? An example of it can be found in "Projects" at the top

# Wiki
- - Use githubs wiki when we make problem analysis and want to document difficult parts of the code? Can serve as an appendix like in aSTEP.? Or maybe we can copy-paste parts of the wiki into the project, such as theory / problem analysis / etc. ? An example of it can be found in "Wiki" at the top 

## Future ideas
- Setup more action flows. Automatic labelling when pull requests or issues are created, setup deletion of stale branches, setup workflows which can be run manually, etc.
- Make an action that set the person initially pushing the code as the Assignee, and setting everyone else as reviewers maybe?
- Create milestones which are the Sprint Goal, and its work items?

## Setup done in the settings
- It is only possible to Squash merge. What this means is that all commits are "squashed" together into one single commit, so that one branch only fills up one commit.
- All branches can only be merged, if they are reviewed by at least one other person
- All branches can only be merged, if they pass the CI

## Maybe Useful Resources and Libraries
- Dockerfile made from this: https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/
- A way to test Docker maybe: https://github.com/avast/pytest-docker
